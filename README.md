## The Task
```
Build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

The application that was created was called Iso Meals; an e-commerce store for people that have been suddenly forced into isolation and may not feel well enough to do their own shopping. This application lets them pick the 'food bundle' of their choice, without having to find and select individual items.
